# React Styling - Exercise

Make sure you are working on your 'dev' branch

1. Create a form using react-bootstrap. Run `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` after installing and setting up React
2. Just have two input fields for firstname and lastname and a submit button. The form doesn't need to do anything
3. The fields and button should be using Bootstrap components
4. Apply additional styling to the form using inline CSS
